This document is work towards getting an XStick onto my home SmartThings network and then creating a program that uses the serial port provided by the XStick to simulate a switch device or others.  

1) Connect an XStick to the computer - tested 2020-05-06 Digi XBee XStick XB24-ZB ZigBee Router API with firmware version 23A7 
2) Guide to connect XStick came from this URL: https://community.smartthings.com/t/faq-mapping-your-zigbee-network-with-digis-xctu/28477/11 
The XStick parameters are set as follows:

3) Then let it run, and the XStick will say in XCTU Network Mode that it cannot read itself
4) Open SmartThings app, add a device, SmartThings, available option was a Temp/Humidity sensor, clicked search/add, power-cycled the XStick and it magically joined the network 
5) Now you can see the other ZigBee things on the SmartThings network - as of 2020-05-06 I could see the Coordinator (presumably the SmartThings hub) and four (4) end devices on my network (probably some switches and sensors - didn't check what's what) 
6) In the SmartThings App, the XStick shows up as a "Thing" in the room I added it to 
7) Later, give that Thing some abilities: Goal is to send messages over serial port, API formatted command packets to the network so this thing acts as a switch that can toggle my garage door button, for example
