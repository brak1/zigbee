#notes on working in a zigbee environment
#prior to trial, read through these notes to plan wireless network setup

#0. Connect an XBee ZigBee USB device; command line "dmesg | grep ttyUSB" to ID the device

#1. Downloaded XCTU application from Digi - 40002881_T.run (Debian Linux x64 download)

#2. "XBee USB Adapter ZB PRO S2B" device firmware not recognized; perform "Install Legacy Radio Firware"

#3. For the aforementioned device in (2.), Click "Update" to Update the radio module firmware; XBP24BZ7 - ZigBee Coordinator AT - 20A7

#4. Example device hookup: "XBee 232 Adapter ZB Pro 9-30V" is recognized as a network remote module by the newly activated coordinator

#5. "It is not possible to configure remote radio modules when the local one is in AT mode."

#6. Changing the device (2.) firmware to API mode. Changes to "ZigBee Coordinator API - 21A7"

#7. Note that with device in API mode, you cannot easily communicate in terminal with "+++" escape comand and then use AT commands.

#8. For API mode, send bytes in HEX to achieve a command but must generate checksum at end of each message via: 0xFF - (0x23 + 0x11) = (0xFF - 0x34) = 0xCB.  Where 0x23 and 0x11 were payload bytes.\

#9.
